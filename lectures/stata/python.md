# Stata and Python

One of the major new features supported since [Stata16](https://www.stata.com/stata-news/news34-3/)
and improved greatly in [Stata17](https://www.stata.com/stata-news/news36-2/)
is the addition of [python integration](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/python-integration/).

These resources are intended to be a guide for those `stata` users that would like to use
`python` as part of their `data` and `analysis` workflows. It can be a good way to get access
to many powerful tools that are available in the `python` ecosystem. 

There are `three` main ways we can use `python` effectively with `stata`:

1. [Using **python** in **stata** (through integrated workflows)](stata/python-integrated)
2. [Using **stata** with **python** (via file based workflows)](stata/python-files)
3. [Using **pystata** package to work with **stata** from python](stata/pystata)

```{note}
In [Stata17](https://www.stata.com/stata-news/news36-2/) StataCorp introduced a
`python` module called `pystata` which brings much tighter integration between the two
software environments.
