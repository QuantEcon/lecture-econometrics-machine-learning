# Stata and Python

```{todo}
@mmcky need to update for [Stata17](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/)
with improvements to:
1. [jupyter interface](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/jupyter-notebooks/)
2. [pystata](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/pystata/)
```

One of the major new features of [Stata16](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/)
is [python integration](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/python-integration/).

There are `two` main ways we can use `python` effectively with `stata`:

1. [Using **python** in **stata** (through integrated workflows)](stata/python-integrated)
2. [Using **stata** with **python** (via file based workflows)](stata/python-files)
